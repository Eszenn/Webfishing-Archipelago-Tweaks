## Bait-Based Quality
Using a given bait will now always catch the highest possible tier for that bait. For example, using Worms will always result in normal quality fish, whereas using Nautiluses will always result in alpha quality fish.

## Unlocked Shop
Everything in the shop is available from the start. Additionally, everything is free so upgrades and cosmetics can be taken as they are received.
